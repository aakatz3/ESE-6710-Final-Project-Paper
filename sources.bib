Due to many degrees of freedom for tuning, previous studies can only solve the single-ended Φ2 circuit using numerical methods. This work focuses on improving the design and operating characteristics of a push–pull Φ2 ampliﬁer with a T network connected between the switch nodes, or a PPT Φ2 ampliﬁer. The PPT Φ2 ampliﬁer has less circulating energy and achieves higher cutoff frequency fT than other Φ2/EF2 circuits. We, then, present a series-stacked input conﬁguration to reduce the switch voltage stress and improve the efﬁciency and power density. A compact 6.78-MHz, 100-V, 300-W prototype converter is demonstrated that uses low-cost Si devices and achieves 96\% peak total efﬁciency and maintains above 94.5\% drain efﬁciency across a wide range of voltage and power. Together with the advances in wide-bandgap semiconductors and magnetic materials, the PPT Φ2 circuit opens more possibilities for the state-of-the-art performance of solid-state RF ampliﬁers in high-frequency, high-power applications, including wireless charging for electric vehicles, plasma RF drives, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {MHz-frequency inductive wireless power transfer holds the promise of compact and cost-effective wireless power transfer. However, due to the sensitivity of the high-frequency circuit operations to the parasitic components, these systems are universally less efficient, on a dc-dc basis, than wireless power systems operating at conventional lower frequency regimes. This article presents the design considerations for inductive power transfer systems operating at multi-MHz frequencies. Specifically, this work comprehensively analyzes the tradeoffs of selecting different compensation topologies, including series-series, series-parallel, parallel-series, and parallel-parallel compensations. The article also provides guidelines for incorporating parasitic components of semiconductor devices into a multi-MHz circuit design to improve transmission efficiency. Validating the design methodologies, we built three 300-W inductive power transfer systems using series-series, series-parallel, and parallel-parallel compensations, all achieving an ac-ac efficiency above 96%, and compared their performances in detail. Finally, we demonstrate a 6.78-MHz prototype inductive power transfer system that delivers 1.7-kW power with a dc-dc efficiency of 95.7%.},

As a core component, the compensation network fundamentally influences overall performance. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs among various compensation topologies and presents a series of design guidelines to achieve maximum power-transfer efficiency. Additionally, experimental results at 6.62MHz and 300W with 10 cm diameter coils at 2 cm separation demonstrate that all four topologies can achieve similar maximum efficiencies exceeding 96%. Although parallel-compensated capacitors may encounter higher thermal stress at elevated power levels, each topology can be optimized to meet specific load and power requirements.},
