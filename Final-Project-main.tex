This final project presents the design and implementation of a 6.78~MHz push--pull $\phi_2$ wireless power transfer system operating from a 25~V dc input and delivering 39~W to the load.
The project encompasses the complete development process, including component parameter calculation, simulation verification, PCB design, wireless charging coil design, and experimental hardware implementation.
The push--pull $\phi_2$ topology is chosen for its suitability for MHz-frequency operation. The resonant network between the switching nodes enables soft-switching behavior, significantly reducing switching losses at 6.78~MHz. 
The push--pull structure distributes the input voltage across two switches, reducing device voltage stress and improving power handling capability under a 25~V input. Furthermore, the $\phi_2$ topology allows component values to be calculated using closed-form equations, simplifying the design and ensuring reliable MHz-frequency operation.
In addition, the symmetric resonant operation helps achieve stable high-frequency performance, which is critical for efficient wireless power transfer.
Simulation and experimental results validate the design methodology and confirm that the implemented converter achieves efficient and reliable wireless power delivery at the specified operating conditions.
This project demonstrates that the push--pull $\phi_2$ topology is an effective solution for medium-power, MHz-frequency wireless power transfer applications.

\section {Design Process}

%\lipsum[5]
\subsection{Coil Design}
%\lipsum[6-7]
\subsection{Circuit Topology}
The overall schematic of the wireless power transfer is shown in \cref{fig:converter-overall-sch}. 
It consists of three main parts: a push--pull $\phi_2$ converter, a wireless power transfer link, and a rectifier. 
The push--pull $\phi_2$ stage shapes the input voltage applied to the resonant tank, while the wireless link enables contactless power transfer, and the rectifier converts the received ac power into dc to supply the load.

In the push--pull $\phi_2$ topology, an auxiliary branch that presents an approximate short circuit to the second harmonic effectively suppresses the second-harmonic component of the drain--source voltage, significantly reducing MOSFET voltage stress. 
The combined action of the resonant components allows the drain--source voltage to naturally resonate to zero, achieving zero-voltage switching and zero-derivative voltage switching. 
Based on the closed-form design methodology of the push--pull $\phi_2$ topology presented in~\cite{gu_pushpull_2020}, the key resonant component values can be directly calculated as
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        L_{\mathrm{MR}} &= 0.94\,\frac{R_L}{\omega_s} \label{eq:LMR} \\
        C_{\mathrm{MR}} &= \frac{1}{4\omega_s^2 L_{\mathrm{MR}}} \label{eq:CMR} \\
        C_p &= \frac{0.61}{\omega_s R_L}. \label{eq:Cp}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Here, $R_L$ is modeled as the equivalent ac-side resistance of the rectifier and is set to 50~$\Omega$ to facilitate circuit tuning and experimental adjustment. 
$L_F$ is a design parameter and is chosen as $L_F = 5L_{\mathrm{MR}}$ in this design.

Wireless energy transfer is realized using a pair of magnetically coupled inductors with identical self-inductance values. 
A voltage-mode converter and rectifier are employed; therefore, series--series (SS) compensation is adopted for the wireless power transfer link. 
To achieve maximum efficiency, the compensation capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ for the coupled coils are calculated using the expressions given in~\cite{gu_design_2025}:
\begin{equation}
    C_1 = \frac{1}{\omega_s^2 L_1} \qquad
    C_2 = \frac{1}{\omega_s^2 L_2}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_s$ denotes the angular switching frequency.
For SS compensation, the inductance required to achieve minimum loss is related to the equivalent load resistance as derived in~\cite{gu_design_2025}:
\begin{equation}
    L_2 \approx \frac{R_{L}}{k\omega_s}
    \label{eq:L2_coupled}
\end{equation}
where $k$ denotes the magnetic coupling coefficient between the transmitter and receiver coils.
Accordingly, the coupling coefficient $k$ and the corresponding coil geometry must be carefully designed to ensure that the required coupling condition can be achieved in practice. 
Since the design specifies a minimum coil separation exceeding 1~inch, the coupling coefficient at a distance of 1~inch must be greater than the target value $k$. 
This design margin allows the effective coupling coefficient to be adjusted during experimental tuning by varying the coil spacing, such that the resulting inductance satisfies~\cref{eq:L2_coupled}, thereby minimizing conduction and resonant losses in the wireless power transfer system.
In the practical implementation, two identical coupled inductors with an inductance of $4.15~\mu\mathrm{H}$ were fabricated and used as the transmitting and receiving coils. 
For this inductance value, the minimum-loss condition corresponds to a coupling coefficient of approximately $k = 0.285$, which was experimentally observed to be achievable when the separation distance between the coils exceeds 1~inch.

The junction capacitance of rectifier diodes causes the rectifier to exhibit a capacitive input impedance when viewed from the AC side, particularly under high-frequency operation. This behavior degrades the input power factor and can be compensated using inductive or reactive elements \cite{gu_design_2025}.
Using a rectifier implemented with the Schottky diode STPS360AF, a simulation-based experiment was conducted to examine the phase relationship between the rectifier input voltage and current. With a parallel inductance of $L_{\mathrm{LP}} = 2.43~\mu\mathrm{H}$, the rectifier input is observed to be approximately resistive.
Following the design process outlined above, the component values employed in the circuit are summarized in \cref{tab:bom}.

%\section{Resonant Tank Characterization}
%In this converter, energy is transferred through a loosely coupled coil pair, whose cantilever‐model parameters—including magnetizing inductance $L_{\mu}$, leakage inductances $L_{\text{leak}}$, and coupling ratios $n$—vary with coil alignment and separation distance. 
%These variations strongly influence the resonant frequency, the impedance seen by the inverter, and the achievable power-transfer efficiency. 
%To characterize the coil pair, a VNA 2180 impedance analyzer is used to extract the parameters of the cantilever transformer model under aligned conditions and across different separation distances.
%The coils were first fixed in place, after which short-circuit and open-circuit tests were performed: the secondary coil was alternately shorted and opened while measuring inductances from the primary side, followed by the primary coil being shorted and opened while measuring from the secondary side.
%The resulting measurements, after calculation, are summarized are summarized in \cref{tab:cantilever_params}.\\

%To emulate the equivalent resistance of the full-bridge rectifier, a $4Ω$ resistor is then connected to the secondary coil.
%With the primary coil connected to the resonance capacitor $C{res}$, the input impedance of the resonant tank is measured using the VNA 2180 under a coil separation of 3 mm. The resulting Bode plot is shown in \cref{fig:resonantbodemeas}.\\
%
%By comparing the curves in \cref{fig:resonantbode}, it is observed that both the measured and simulated responses indicate a resonant frequency of approximately 130 kHz.\\

%\section{LTSpice Simulation}
%In the simulation , the wireless receiver and transmitter coils are represented using the cantilever transformer model. 
%To ensure consistency with the hardware evaluation, the model parameters are set to match those measured at a coil separation of 3 mm, as listed in \cref{tab:cantilever_params}. 
%An ideal transformer is implemented using a controlled current source to emulate the coupling behavior prescribed by the cantilever model. 
%The corresponding simulation results are presented in \cref{sec:results}.
%
%\section {Experimental Setup and Procedure}
%The primary-side PCB was assembled using solder paste, a stencil, and a reflow oven, followed by hand-soldering of through-hole components and inspection for shorts. 
%After assembly, the test setup followed the prescribed procedure: a DMM continuity check was performed, DC terminals were connected with correct polarity, and a 200 kHz gate-drive square wave was applied with the function generator set to high-impedance mode. 
%With only the +5 V rail enabled, the gate-to-source voltages of the half-bridge MOSFETs were verified to be complementary 5 V signals with a sufficient dead time of approximately 40 ns. 
%Enabling the +24 V supply, the switched node waveform was confirmed to toggle between 0 V and 24 V. 
%Finally, proper operation was verified over a switching-frequency range of 100–500 kHz.\\
%\indent
%The secondary-side rectifier was assembled on a bare FR4 board using discrete diodes, capacitors, and copper tape. 
%The TX/RX coils were mounted and aligned using a 3D-printed fixture. Finally, the inverter, coils, and rectifier were assembled together to form the complete wireless power converter.\\
%\indent
%A Keysight EL34143A electronic load was used to provide the output load while measuring output voltage, current, and power. 
%The 24V input supply was monitored with a digital multimeter to obtain the input voltage and current. 
%Two Keysight 1147B current probes were used to capture both the primary-side current and the input current waveforms, while two Keysight 10073D passive probes measured the output voltage and the switched-node voltage of the bottom MOSFET. 
%A Python script was used to automate sweeping of the gate-drive frequency and electronic-load settings during measurement.
