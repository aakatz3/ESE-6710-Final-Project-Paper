This project implements a 6.78-MHz wireless power transfer based on a push--pull $\phi_2$ topology. 
The wireless power transfer operates from a 25~V dc input and delivers 39~W output power with high efficiency.
The push--pull $\phi_2$ structure enables soft switching at MHz frequencies, reduces switch voltage stress, and improves power handling capability, making it well suited for efficient wireless power transfer applications.

This final project presents the design and implementation of a 6.78~MHz push--pull $\phi_2$ wireless power transfer system operating from a 25~V dc input and delivering 39~W to the load.
The project encompasses the complete development process, including component parameter calculation, simulation verification, PCB design, wireless charging coil design, and experimental hardware implementation.
The push--pull $\phi_2$ topology is chosen for its suitability for MHz-frequency operation. The resonant network between the switching nodes enables soft-switching behavior, significantly reducing switching losses at 6.78~MHz. 
The push--pull structure distributes the input voltage across two switches, reducing device voltage stress and improving power handling capability under a 25~V input. Furthermore, the $\phi_2$ topology allows component values to be calculated using closed-form equations, simplifying the design and ensuring reliable MHz-frequency operation.
In addition, the symmetric resonant operation helps achieve stable high-frequency performance, which is critical for efficient wireless power transfer.
Simulation and experimental results validate the design methodology and confirm that the implemented converter achieves efficient and reliable wireless power delivery at the specified operating conditions.
This project demonstrates that the push--pull $\phi_2$ topology is an effective solution for medium-power, MHz-frequency wireless power transfer applications.

%\section{Resonant Tank Characterization}
%In this converter, energy is transferred through a loosely coupled coil pair, whose cantilever‐model parameters—including magnetizing inductance $L_{\mu}$, leakage inductances $L_{\text{leak}}$, and coupling ratios $n$—vary with coil alignment and separation distance. 
%These variations strongly influence the resonant frequency, the impedance seen by the inverter, and the achievable power-transfer efficiency. 
%To characterize the coil pair, a VNA 2180 impedance analyzer is used to extract the parameters of the cantilever transformer model under aligned conditions and across different separation distances.
%The coils were first fixed in place, after which short-circuit and open-circuit tests were performed: the secondary coil was alternately shorted and opened while measuring inductances from the primary side, followed by the primary coil being shorted and opened while measuring from the secondary side.
%The resulting measurements, after calculation, are summarized are summarized in \cref{tab:cantilever_params}.\\
%
%\begin{table}[!ht]
%    \centering
%    \caption{Measured cantilever-model parameters at different coil separations}
%    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
%        \toprule
%        \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{3 mm} & \textbf{6 mm} \\
%        \midrule
%            Magnetizing inductance $L_{\mu}$ (µH)   & --- & --- \\
%            Leakage inductance $L_{\text{leak}}$ (µH) & --- & --- \\
%            Coupling ratio $n$                      & --- & --- \\

%\end{table}
%
%To emulate the equivalent resistance of the full-bridge rectifier, a $4Ω$ resistor is then connected to the secondary coil.
%With the primary coil connected to the resonance capacitor $C{res}$, the input impedance of the resonant tank is measured using the VNA 2180 under a coil separation of 3 mm. The resulting Bode plot is shown in \cref{fig:resonantbodemeas}.\\
%
%By comparing the curves in \cref{fig:resonantbode}, it is observed that both the measured and simulated responses indicate a resonant frequency of approximately 130 kHz.\\

%\section{LTSpice Simulation}
%In the simulation , the wireless receiver and transmitter coils are represented using the cantilever transformer model. 
%To ensure consistency with the hardware evaluation, the model parameters are set to match those measured at a coil separation of 3 mm, as listed in \cref{tab:cantilever_params}. 
%An ideal transformer is implemented using a controlled current source to emulate the coupling behavior prescribed by the cantilever model. 
%The corresponding simulation results are presented in \cref{sec:results}.
%
%\section {Experimental Setup and Procedure}
%The primary-side PCB was assembled using solder paste, a stencil, and a reflow oven, followed by hand-soldering of through-hole components and inspection for shorts. 
%After assembly, the test setup followed the prescribed procedure: a DMM continuity check was performed, DC terminals were connected with correct polarity, and a 200 kHz gate-drive square wave was applied with the function generator set to high-impedance mode. 
%With only the +5 V rail enabled, the gate-to-source voltages of the half-bridge MOSFETs were verified to be complementary 5 V signals with a sufficient dead time of approximately 40 ns. 
%Enabling the +24 V supply, the switched node waveform was confirmed to toggle between 0 V and 24 V. 
%Finally, proper operation was verified over a switching-frequency range of 100–500 kHz.\\
%\indent
%The secondary-side rectifier was assembled on a bare FR4 board using discrete diodes, capacitors, and copper tape. 
%The TX/RX coils were mounted and aligned using a 3D-printed fixture. Finally, the inverter, coils, and rectifier were assembled together to form the complete wireless power converter.\\
%\indent
%A Keysight EL34143A electronic load was used to provide the output load while measuring output voltage, current, and power. 
%The 24V input supply was monitored with a digital multimeter to obtain the input voltage and current. 
%Two Keysight 1147B current probes were used to capture both the primary-side current and the input current waveforms, while two Keysight 10073D passive probes measured the output voltage and the switched-node voltage of the bottom MOSFET. 
%A Python script was used to automate sweeping of the gate-drive frequency and electronic-load settings during measurement.
