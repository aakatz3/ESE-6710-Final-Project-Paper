\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this lab, a wireless Class-D resonant DC–DC converter is analyzed through theoretical modeling, LTSpice simulation, and experimental measurements. 
As shown in \cref{fig:classd}, the converter consists of a half-bridge inverter, a resonant tank formed by the leakage and magnetizing inductances of a cantilever transformer together with a series resonant capacitor, a pair of wireless transmitter/receiver coils, and a secondary full-bridge rectifier with an output filter. 
First, the TX/RX coils are characterized using an impedance analyzer to extract the resonant tank parameters—leakage inductance, magnetizing inductance, and coupling ratio—at different coil spacings. 
LTSpice simulations are then used to examine the converter’s performances and waveforms under varying switching frequencies and load conditions.
Finally, a practical Class-D wireless power converter is assembled using a PCB on the primary side and a hand-built rectifier board on the secondary side.
Experimental measurements are performed over a range of switching frequencies and load conditions to observe the converter behavior below resonance, at resonance, and above resonance.

\section{Specifications}


\section{Resonant Tank Characterization}
In this converter, energy is transferred through a loosely coupled coil pair, whose cantilever‐model parameters—including magnetizing inductance $L_{\mu}$, leakage inductances $L_{\text{leak}}$, and coupling ratios $n$—vary with coil alignment and separation distance. 
These variations strongly influence the resonant frequency, the impedance seen by the inverter, and the achievable power-transfer efficiency. 
To characterize the coil pair, a VNA 2180 impedance analyzer is used to extract the parameters of the cantilever transformer model under aligned conditions and across different separation distances.
The coils were first fixed in place, after which short-circuit and open-circuit tests were performed: the secondary coil was alternately shorted and opened while measuring inductances from the primary side, followed by the primary coil being shorted and opened while measuring from the secondary side.
The resulting measurements, after calculation, are summarized are summarized in \cref{tab:cantilever_params}.\\

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Measured cantilever-model parameters at different coil separations}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{3 mm} & \textbf{6 mm} \\
        \midrule
            Magnetizing inductance $L_{\mu}$ (µH)   & --- & --- \\
            Leakage inductance $L_{\text{leak}}$ (µH) & --- & --- \\
            Coupling ratio $n$                      & --- & --- \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:cantilever_params}
\end{table}

To emulate the equivalent resistance of the full-bridge rectifier, a $4Ω$ resistor is then connected to the secondary coil.
With the primary coil connected to the resonance capacitor $C{res}$, the input impedance of the resonant tank is measured using the VNA 2180 under a coil separation of 3 mm. The resulting Bode plot is shown in \cref{fig:resonantbodemeas}.\\

By comparing the curves in \cref{fig:resonantbode}, it is observed that both the measured and simulated responses indicate a resonant frequency of approximately 130 kHz.\\

\section{LTSpice Simulation}
In the simulation , the wireless receiver and transmitter coils are represented using the cantilever transformer model. 
To ensure consistency with the hardware evaluation, the model parameters are set to match those measured at a coil separation of 3 mm, as listed in \cref{tab:cantilever_params}. 
An ideal transformer is implemented using a controlled current source to emulate the coupling behavior prescribed by the cantilever model. 
The corresponding simulation results are presented in \cref{sec:results}.

\section {Experimental Setup and Procedure}
The primary-side PCB was assembled using solder paste, a stencil, and a reflow oven, followed by hand-soldering of through-hole components and inspection for shorts. 
After assembly, the test setup followed the prescribed procedure: a DMM continuity check was performed, DC terminals were connected with correct polarity, and a 200 kHz gate-drive square wave was applied with the function generator set to high-impedance mode. 
With only the +5 V rail enabled, the gate-to-source voltages of the half-bridge MOSFETs were verified to be complementary 5 V signals with a sufficient dead time of approximately 40 ns. 
Enabling the +24 V supply, the switched node waveform was confirmed to toggle between 0 V and 24 V. 
Finally, proper operation was verified over a switching-frequency range of 100–500 kHz.\\
\indent
The secondary-side rectifier was assembled on a bare FR4 board using discrete diodes, capacitors, and copper tape. 
The TX/RX coils were mounted and aligned using a 3D-printed fixture. Finally, the inverter, coils, and rectifier were assembled together to form the complete wireless power converter.\\
\indent
A Keysight EL34143A electronic load was used to provide the output load while measuring output voltage, current, and power. 
The 24V input supply was monitored with a digital multimeter to obtain the input voltage and current. 
Two Keysight 1147B current probes were used to capture both the primary-side current and the input current waveforms, while two Keysight 10073D passive probes measured the output voltage and the switched-node voltage of the bottom MOSFET. 
A Python script was used to automate sweeping of the gate-drive frequency and electronic-load settings during measurement.
